1. design the complete layout of the app in 2d

2. foreach element of this layout make a list of events that are generated by this elements

3. which elements can be made to components (are reusable outside of the special use case)?
    they have to reside in separate files each

4. make the css for each component separately, also each in it's own file

5. the creation argument is the interface to the component

6. calling function on a component goes via 
    a. sending a custom event (return values?): trigger -> listenTo
    b. a collection of function objects stored inside the DOM-Element (unclean)
        e.g. listElement.mmm.onClick = (ev) => {}, mmm is my private namespace.
        a cleaner method would be using the data mechanism (clumsy)
