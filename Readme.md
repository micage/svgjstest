### What is it?
Two things. First a test run for a Vector2 class using svg.js for displaying vectors as [SVGLineElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGLineElement)s and second a tree replication function.

### Installing
Go to a directory of your choice

Get the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/micage/svgjstest.git
```

Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Then type one of the following ...

#### Vector2 Test
Vector2 class that implements operations you can do with a pair of numbers. ES6 code.
Uses [svg.js](https://github.com/svgdotjs/svg.js) for displaying the vectors. Arranged in a MVC-Pattern by using my [DOM-Ponents](https://github.com/micage/DOM-Ponents) library.
Starts devserver on port 3014 -> localhost:3014
```
npm run vector2
```

#### Tree Replication Test
First a tree is generated by an object literal. By traversing this tree
a user callback is called for each node. This node essentially has an
id and two boolean flags: hasChildren and isLastChild. Provided solely with this
information a copy of the original object is created. 

This is the basis for a lot of tree gernerating/transforming algorithms.
It proofs that the structure of a tree can be serialized as a sequence of
two flags and the node related data and be deserialized later from this sequence.
```
let node = {
    id: "some id",
    hasChildren = true|false,
    isLastChild = true|false,
    data: {}
}
```

This has no GUI, only devtools console output.
Starts devserver on port 3015 -> localhost:3015
```
npm run tree
```

### Caution and disclaimer
All work in progress and highly experimental
